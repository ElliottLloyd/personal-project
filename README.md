# Personal Project

## Start

---

At the start of this project, the code asks which account you like to log on to out of three options:
 
- Elliott
- George
- Bob

## Password

---

The code will then ask you to input a password, each one different for the seperate accounts. These passwords are scrambled, so cannot be found through the data stored in the .json files.

## Menu

---

The main menu has many options on different features of the users profile:

### Close Code:

This stops the code from running.

### Family:

This shows information about the users family, with an option for more info of each member of the family.

### Friends:

This presents a list of friends, and gives you the option to:
    
- Add friend: Add a friend and the stored data for them, and more information about them, such as their friends.This can be cancelled by typing 'cancel' into the input.
- Remove friend: Removes a friend from the list, and removes the stored data for them. This can be cancelled by leaving the input blank.
- Get info: Gives the information of the friend, their best friends, then returns you to the main menu. This can be cancelled by leaving the input blank.
